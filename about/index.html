title: Petar Ivcec, Full Stack JavaScript Developer

<p>
  I have spent 5 years living and working in various countries such as Brazil,
  Greece, Czech Republic, Italy and Croatia. I recently returned to my home
  country of Canada in order to be close to family.
</p>

<p>
  Computers are something that I have been close to since I was an adolescent
  using an IBM compatible 486 to play games such as Doom or browse dialup BBS
  services.
</p>

<p>
  The first websites that I built were with self-hosted WordPress installations,
  and it was then that I started learning about HTML; CSS; PHP;
  JavaScript/JQuery and MySQL - while working on theme and plugin
  customizations.
</p>

<p>
  It was not until I became an Eglish teacher working in Brazil that one of my
  students started to teach me about deeper programming concepts - because we
  figured out that that was actually the best way for him to improve his
  English. That was when I created my own, custom CMS and began to utilize the
  power of relational databases in order to perform enhanced logic.
</p>

<p>
  The next challenge that I gave myself was that of writing a mobile app to
  function as an English verb conjugation tool. I chose React Native as a
  platform, and this was when I started to delve much deeper into JavaScript
  itself. Using React - especially with Redux - has been a wonderful
  introduction into the world of functional programming.
</p>

<p>
  My next step was to begin to work as a professional developer in Prague
  (yacht-rental meta-search). That was my first job working in an Agile team
  with a large, existing web application. Working in that team taught me a lot
  about using Git, and also taught me about the importance of intra-team
  communication - especially when it comes to estimations and managing
  expectations surrounding deadlines.
</p>

<p>
  My next professional role was at a company in Milan (fintech). This role very
  much reinforced the lessons that I had learned in Prague regarding the
  importance of intra-team communication.
</p>

<p>
  My goal now is very much to become the change that I wish to see in the
  industry. I genuinely enjoy onboarding new employees and helping more junior
  developers whenever I can. I try to do whatever I can to foster as much
  intra-team communication and support as possible.
