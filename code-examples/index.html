<h3>Singing Game</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    Experiment that I did that combines React.js with an WebGL/Canvas library
    called Pixi.js:
    <a href="https://github.com/pivcec/singing-game" target="_blank">link</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    It animates some notes across the screen and uses HTML5 mic input along with
    a Node module that analyzes audio in real-time in order to extract frequency
    data.
  </li>
  <li>
    If a user is able to match the currently active note with his/her actual
    voice, then that note will change colour to indicate a match.
  </li>
  <li>
    Link to a youtube video of it in action, in case you are curious (please
    don't mind the bizarre singing that I had to do in order to match the
    notes):

</ul>

<h3>React + Three.js</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    Experiment that I did that combines React.js with Three.js:
    <a
      href="https://codesandbox.io/s/github/pivcec/react-plus-three.js"
      target="_blank"
      >link</a
    >
  </li>
  <li>
    The idea here is that React.js can be used to create a user interface that
    is able to control the properties of an animation in real-time.
  </li>
  <li>
    The following experiment is very similar, but loads a medical imaging
    library within React + Three.js:
    <a
      href="https://codesandbox.io/s/github/pivcec/ami_plus_react"
      target="_blank"
      >link</a
    >
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Coding Test 1</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    Programming test that I did for a company that required me to implement a
    design with a lot of fancy CSS (transitions, etc):
    <a
      href="https://codesandbox.io/s/colony-coding-challenge-32ihm"
      target="_blank"
      >link</a
    >
  </li>
  <li>
    I also wrote a lot of unit tests for this project.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Coding Test 2</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    Programming test that required me to implement a design for a form:
    <a
      href="https://codesandbox.io/s/github/pivcec/validation-with-formik-example"
      target="_blank"
      >link</a
    >
  </li>
  <li>
    I used Formik library for validation because Formik is absolutely the best
    way that I know for doing form validation with React.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Coding Test 3</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    Programming test that required me to consume an API and create an interface
    for presenting information about dog breeds:
    <a href="https://codesandbox.io/s/wqx5nnro15" target="_blank">link</a>
  </li>
</ul>
